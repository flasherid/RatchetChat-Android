## Ratchet chat

This is a stupid simple chat app that talks to the corresponding [PHP backend](https://github.com/scotttherobot/RatchetChat) via an equally simple API. The full features of the API are highlighted in its repo, and this app supports most of those features.

# Feature highlights
* Account creation
* Push notification subscription
* Geolocation updating
* Group threads
* Renaming existing threads
* Invite users to threads
* Leave threads
* Send photos in threads

# TODO:
* Add support for setting profile photos.
* Add per-thread notification on/off switch.
